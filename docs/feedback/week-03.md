#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You had a chair and a minute taker. Good job!

#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was uploaded to the main branch only a few hours before the meeting. Next time try to upload it at least in the morning of the day of the meeting. Furthermore, you did not improve upon my points from last week. The bulletpoint formatting did not work with the markdown document and none of the points have a description providing some context.

I liked the fact that you decided to let the TA speak at the beginning as my opinion is that I might provide you some information that would be helpful during the meeting. This way no repetition is needed.

From next week I would also expect the meeting to contain a demo of the current state of the application. Adding a small round in which everyone talks about their tasks for the previous week and any difficulties that they have encountered would be also advised.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You did a great job at uploading the meeting notes on the main branch soon after the meeting. As the noted information is crucial for everyone this helps a lot with knowing who is working on what and what has been discussed during the meeting. The usage of the agenda template as the backbone of the notes is also great as it provides a clear structure and context for the notes. I would suggest that if you have any additional information you should add it at the end of the document.

The amount of notes is great and they cover all the discussion topics of the meeting. Some points of improvement would be to try to avoid vague statements like "divide backlog". For that specific example, you could try to note the strategy that is going to be used. As a note-taker, you are also a member of the meeting and are allowed, even encouraged, to ask questions if something is not clear.

I also don't see any notes regarding the task distribution. I would suggest that you add this information at the end of the document or under any topic which requires it. However, having a complete view at the end of the document would be very useful for team members to see what everyone is up to. Try to be more specific in the future and avoid statements such as "almost everyone ... (5/6)". Despite this, your notes detail tasks that are realistic and a good fit for the situation in which the team was at that point. They are not overly optimistic, expecting everyone to be a Spring master by the next week, while also setting some expectations.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I liked that you started with a summary of what was going to be discussed during the meeting. This is a great way to bring everyone up to speed and to check for any last-minute additions. You also did a great job at adapting to my request to discuss everyone's tasks for this week and their performance. I think you've handled the change really well and managed to stick to the rest of the agenda while doing so.

You involved everyone in the discussions and made sure that you took their opinions into consideration while guiding the discussion on every topic. You also took notice of people raising their hands to speak and adapted the discussion order based on that. When the discussion deviated from the bullet point at hand you also tried to steer the discussion back while reminding everyone that the current topic is not done yet and that whatever they would like to discuss is scheduled for later in the meeting.

Another observation that I made is that you prompted people to share their findings (from the proposed research on JavaFX and Spring) with others such that the entire team could gather more knowledge. At the end, you would also try to summarize everything, which is a great approach. You were also exactly on time.

The only point of improvement would be that some people were a bit more quiet than others and I believe that you could've done a bit more to encourage them to speak up. Make sure that they are comfortable with sharing their ideas, but sometimes asking questions could be a useful strategy to improve the distribution during the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and were in full control for the entirety of it. The atmosphere was great and I even heard about certain cases in which people helped each other solve their issues. This shows that you have developed a great teamwork spirit and that you are willing to work together to complete this project.

During this meeting, there was a slight imbalance in the discussion, with some people not speaking that much. This is something that I believe you as a team should try to work on. Other than that, I observed that people were very willing to share their findings and discuss their ideas. You've had some great discussions that built on top of each other's ideas and that is a great sign of a team that is working well together.

I liked the feedback round at the end of the meeting and the fact that you are proud of the progress that you've made so far is a good sign.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: You did not show me a demo of the application so it is somewhat hard for me to gauge how you are doing, but from what I've gotten during the meeting you are making great progress. You've managed to test a lot of the application (also a great way to obtain lines of code) which will prove very useful later on. I've understood that you also implemented the base classes and some back-end APIs.

Using Postman to test your APIs and classes is also a good approach that will help you progress with the project and I believe that reaching a point in which you are able to do that is a good sign.

Having people in the team who are also looking at how the front end could be designed to allow for the language change is great, as that could cause problems in the future if you do not take it into consideration from the start. Overall, I believe you've made some great progress since last week towards your goals and if you continue like this you will have a working application by the end of the course.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Based on the discussion of what everyone had done during the previous week it seems that you have a roughly equal work distribution. this being the first week when people are learning about the framework and the project, discrepancies are bout to appear, but I believe that you are on the right track. Everyone within your team is eager to work and there does not seem to be anyone who is not interested in the success of the project.

As stated during the meeting, I would encourage you to use the time estimate features on GitLab to track your work contributions as having every member able to estimate their workload was very useful during the meeting. You are also doing great at using the GitLab issues to track your progress and I would encourage you to continue doing that.
