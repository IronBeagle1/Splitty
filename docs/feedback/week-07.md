#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and a note taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was merged in the main branch of the repository on time and it did follow the template with improvements. The individual points have a somewhat clear description (considering the explanation in brackets), but I would like to see some subpoints being used. The formating for the optional freatures is also a it broken, making the subpoints hard to read. Make sure this does not happen in the future. However, most talking points should have some small subpoints containing questions or topics that you want to touch on.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes were merged into the agenda file on main. The amount of notes is very good and the notes are clear and easy to follow. The formatting which follows the agenda template is great.

The notes do not contain concrete agreements on what should be done in the next sprint. You also don't assign tasks to people.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You followed the template well and guided the discussions for that to happen. I would've liked the meeting to start with a small summary of what was going to be discussed. I like that you took initiative when needed (covering edge cases). Sometimes you asked specific (more quiet) people for their opinion which is very good.

Another great observation is that you wanted to clarify points that were unclear. You kept pushing the discussion to obtain a clear answer.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and the athmosphere was cosntructive. People could express their ideas regarding speciffic topics. There still is a small imbalance in how much each team member talks during the meeting. When people spoke, they were listened to and their ideas were taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

*TA Instructions:*
Please consider the following dimensions in your assessment:

- Did the team present the current state of their application?
- Was the application *potentially shippable*, i.e., all presented changes were merged into main?
- Was there progress compared to last week?
- Is the team on a good track to create a working application until project end?

Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

Feedback: You presented the current state of the application. Most features were merged into main (except the UI for the language change). There was progress compared to last week. You now have working websockets and you can see live updates during the demo. Working like this you are on track to obtain a good application by the end of the project with extra features.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: You did discuss the action list of last week. It seems that you've managed to mostly reach all of your goals including some bug fixing on the side. It seems like most of you are contributing equally to the team but there is a slight imbalance in the contributions which seems to be a recurring problem.
