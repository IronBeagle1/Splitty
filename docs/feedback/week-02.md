# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and note take assigned for this meeting with the chair preparing an agenda.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: In the future make sure that the agenda in on the main branch as that would make it easier for all team members, the TA, and lecturers to find it. Good job on posting it on time (the day before) such that everyone can read it and prepare.

The agenda itself followed the provided template and contained multiple discussion topics. In the future I would also sugest that for larger points you could add sub-points or a short description of the subject. This could also be used for potential ideas that need to be discussed and remembered or examples of bugs.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Not applicable this week


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You've moderated the discussion raelly well and managed to cover all the proposed topics in the estimated amount of time (it was even tracked by a team member on their phone, impressive). I believe that you've also managed to maintain a good distribution between the time spent by the chair and the other team members during discussions.

I don't really see any points of improvement in this regard. You've done a great job and I would encourage you to continue with the same approach in the future.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: As stated, you've managed to lead the meeting yourself really well, to the point where I did not have to interveene at all. You managed to create a great atmosphere during the meeting, where everyone was able to share their ideas and counterpoints. While doing so, people were also respectful of eachother and waited for their turn. This could have been seen in people's willingness to share their concerns about the git assignment and the checkstyle.

Another great point was that you've kept an upbeat mood during the meeting, where people also felt like they could make small jokes or comments. I believe that this will help the team to bond and work together better in the future. The ony suggestion that I have is to try to push less talkative people to share their ideas a bit more while of course keeping them comfortable.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You've made some great progress towards understanding the project and how to approach it. The discussion about initial models for the application based on your IDM and WDT knowledge is a great step forward. It was especially great that there was an already existing model with which the team can start working.

Organizing yourself to search for tutorials before the lectures and discuss them is also a great step that will surely help you get familiar with the template of the project early. Make sure to use this knowledge to bring everyone in the team to the same level of uderstanding such that you can have a solid understanding in the future.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Your team seems to aim to obtain an equal disribution of work between team members as shown by your work for the code of conduct. This week everyone seems to have started working on their tasks, with some cases where people did extra work. 

You've also had an interesting approach where you proposed working on overleaf and git to make sure that your work distribution is also visible for written assignments. This is a good idea, but make sure that it does not put too much pressure on the team. Before making this decision do consult the grading rubric to help you decide if it is ncessary.
