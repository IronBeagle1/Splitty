## Formative Meeting Feedback - W1

This week's meeting was ment for everyone in the team to get to know each other and help establish the basis for the team formation process. You were supposed to start discussing the project, the course schedule, and the Code of Conduct.

As mentioned, the TA is supposed to speak as little as possible therefore you will receive feedback on your self-organization.


#### 1) Self-organization - **Good**

I think that you managed to keep the discussion going well without many prompts from my side. From my observations you had a lot of discussions that ment people would throw ideas and counterpoints at each other. You guys seemed to respect the order in which the conversations should go by not interuption one another.

Regarding each member's involvement in the discussions I've noticed some inbalances but for a first meeting there is nothing too problematic. I would encourage you to keep track of this in te future.

One think that I've noticed is that people were taking notes for what should be discussed at later points in the meeting, with a very helpful summary offered at the end.

#### 2) Suggested Topics - **Good**

I liked how you discussed the topics that were on the agenda (set by the lecturers) and I think that you've managed to touch on all the points. You also managed to bring up points that you though were not solved yet (voting system and scheduling).
