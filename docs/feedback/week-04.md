#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and a note taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was uploaded on time on the main branch of the repository. It follows the template provided on Brightspace.

The individual points were not that clear. For example, I do not see what the relation between the architecture of the front-end and the problems with task distribution is. Why is this only one discussion point? The same goes for the admin panel and "continuing work from last week". If there is some link that I could not notice it would've been great to have subpoints that explain this. Try having the discussion point be more specific and clear (a few workds) with subpoints that explain the context of the discussion point.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes were uploaded a few days before the next meeting, but it would've been better to do it a bit earlier. The idea is that everyone should use those meetings to prepare their sprint. The amount of notes is very good and they are clear. It is also great that you are using the agenda template for that week to take notes. In the future try to be more mindful about the formating (spacing and tabs). It is great that you have concrete agreements on who is going to work on what.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Had a great start and nicely guided the team while discussing what everyone did the previous week. In the begining skipped a bit over the agenda points but realized it and went back. People started talking about the admin panel a bit before the talking point. You did notice that but the discussion did steer towards the admin panel.

People lost what agenda point was being discussed. You should have clarified a bit more what was being discussed, but, I think, that this was also a problem with the agenda point being too vague. By the end of the meeting you also lost a bit of your authority and the meeting became more quided through the concensus of the team.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and only involved the TA only when needing extra clarification regarding rubrics, opinions, or advice. Everyone was active during the meeting if prompted, but there is a discrepancy when it comes to the amount of talking people do. So people are involved in all discussion while others are only listening.

The overall athmosphere was great for discussing ideas and sharing opinions. People raised their concerns regarding testing the front-end and if the current architecture allows for that. Furthermore, you had to discuss the code duplication and how to solve it.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You did show me a demo and it looks like your project is progressig really well. It looks like you are done with almost all of the basic features. The language feature seems to almost be ready with the potential to add an extra language very easily (according to you). 

I've also heard that you have some code duplication (three methods doing the same thing) that shows that there are some problems in your organisation. This might become a problem later on in the project and needs to be solved as soon as possible or it is going to hinder your progress.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You had a part of the meeting dedicated to talking about what everyone did this week. You all seemed to finish working on your tasks. You also seem to be commited to the project and to equally contribute towards it. During the task distribution you also considered equally distributing the tasks between eachother
