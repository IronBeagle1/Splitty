#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You had a chair and a note taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was merge into main on time. It followed the template and even improved uppon it by using bolds and highlights. Each talking point was concise with a great description made through the usage of subpoints.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes were marged into main shortly after the meeting. The formatting is great as it is based on that week's agenda. The amount of notes is great and each one of them is very clear. You made use of bolding and indenting to make the notes more readable. The agreements for the following week are concrete and actionable.

One point of improvement would be to include a short summary after each talking point. With this many notes, it can be hard to quickly go through them.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You started with an announcement about the upcoming assignments which is very good. Followed the agenda really well and managed to moderate the discussion in such a way as to keep the time constraints in mind. Good job on identifying the need to redistribute unfinished tasks to the next sprint. You also included other people's opinions when discussing important topics (websockets and long-polling).

You should also try to include everyone in the discussion. There was some heavy imbalance when considering who talked and how much. You did ask for feedback but more targeted questions could help.

Your time estimation in the agenda was a bit tight and you did not manage to stick to the proposed plan. In the future make sure to prioritize the most important topics. For example you did not manage to cover dividing tasks which is one of the MOST IMPORTANT topics of the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting very well. Not everyone in the team was involved in the meeting to the same level so you should pay more attention to this. The athmosphere was construtive and a lot of very good agreements were made, but make sure to include everyone in the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented the current state of the application through a demo. The application is also done with all the basic requirements. There was progress compared to last meeting. You have concrete agreements on how to continue with websockets and long-polling. If you continue working like this your project will be done on time with extra features.

The progress was a bit smaller than I would've expected for a two week interval, at least compared to the progress seen last meeting. Regardless, you are on a good track to create a good application by the end of the project


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: You discussed the action list of the previous weeks. Everyone had a clear goal in the previous weeks. Sometimes things didn't work out or required much more time than estimated leading to some unfinished tasks. You should look into your process for estimating how much a task takes to avoid this in the future.
