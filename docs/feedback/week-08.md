#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and a note taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You added the agenda to the repository on time and it did follow the template with some great improvements. The individual points have a somewhat clear description (considering the explanation in brackets), but I would like to see that the subpoints a better formated (separate lines and actuall bullet points with indentation). The amount of talking points and their granularity is good.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes were merged into the agenda file but it very late (almost before the next meeting). The agenda should be uploaded as soon as possible. The amount of notes is great and they are clear and easy to follow. The formatting is also great as you use the agenda template. The notes contain concrete agreements on who is going to work on what. These agreements are actionable and realistic.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You did follow the agenda from the start. I would've liked if you started with a short summary of what is going to be discussed in the meeting. You did a good job on sticking only to pressing issues and not going off topic. You also asked people for their feedback and listened to their opinions and additions.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and the athmosphere was constructive leading to great discussion regarding the task distribution and implementation ideas. Everyone was active during the meeting and their ideas were listened to and taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented the current state of the application. There were some bugs in the application and it seems like the main branch didn't have all the changes merged into it. There was progress compared to last week. You are on track to finish the basic tasks with some extra features.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You discussed the action list of the previous week. Not everyone seems to have finished their tasks or contributed to the project. Otherwise people seem to have finished their tasks. Because of the afformentioned issue, the distribution seems to be a bit offif you also consider that some people are also contributing much more than others.
